# textSummarization
This project explores the application of the TextRank algorithm to the task of automatic text summarization. The TextRank algorithm ranks the importance of sentences in a text by representing the text as a graph, with vertices representing sentences and edges representing similarity between sentences. The texts to be summarized were news articles taken from the Daily Mail data set. Each text contained in the data set is accompanied by a human generated summary which may be used as reference summary against which automatically generated summaries may be assessed. Summarization was implemented according to five methods, three of which employed the TextRank algorithm. The aim of this work was to assess how the basic TextRank method compared to the simpler TF-IDF method; and to assess whether sentence embedding and unsupervised classification could be employed to further improve performance. The results suggest that the basic TextRank performed best (highest accuracy, lowest computational demand). The methods employing sentence embedding and unsupervised classification did not deliver further performance improvements.
